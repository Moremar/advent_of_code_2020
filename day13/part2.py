# We get a list of k equations of the form t = ai [ni] with all ni prime with each other.
# This means we can apply the CRT (chinese remainders theorem) saying there is a unique solution for t
# smaller than the product of all ni.
#
# The solution is t = ((a1 * N1 * y1) + (a2 * N2 * y2) + ... + (ak * Nk * yk)) % N
# with :
#  N  = the product of the ni in the k equations
#  ai = the expected remainder in the ith equation
#  Mi = N / ni
#  yi = Mi^-1 the modular inverse or Mi, so that Mi * yi = 1 [ni]
#
# The modular inverse can be calculated from the extended Euclide inverse algorithm.
# it gives GCD(a, b), and a pair of numbers (u, v) so that au + bv = GCD(a, b)
# When a and b are prime with each other, GCD(a, b) = 1, so :
#    au + bv = 1    =>    au = 1 [b]    =>    u is the modular inverse of a modulo b
# With the same logic, v is the modular inverse of b modulo a
